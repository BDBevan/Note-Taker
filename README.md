# Note Taker Application

# Description
My Note Taker application allows users to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an Express.js backend to handle data storage and retrieval via a JSON file. It is ideal for anyone needing to keep track of tasks and thoughts in an organized way.

- Users can create notes by entering a title and content and using the save button to save the note that will then appear in the left pane.
- Users can then view individual notes by selected them from the left pane.
- Users can delete notes by clicking the trash can icon healping to keep the workspace clean.
